# Pixel 2 Adventures

Some basics to setting up a Google Chromebook Pixel 2 (2015) into a development environment.

*This is particular to my setup and not a general guide for installation.*

__Use at your own risk__


## Few things to note

* Don't mess with python

  It comes preinstalled so no need to do anything. Breaking python links will break installations later down the line. Particularly regarding vim + python, ex: YouCompleteMe.


* Switch terminal to `UTF-8`

  If using stock fxce, it will be set to something else.


* Default crouton browser *sucks* (no other way to put it)

  Download Chrome Linux in ChromeOS mode and just install via shared download folder.


* Fonts are not bad, but it's not great.

  Installing a very large font-package helps. But you probably can get away with a lot (a lot) less.


* Switching back and forth causes the mouse to freak on when returning back into crouton.

  This only happens when moving into linux, going back to ChromeOS is fine.


* Trackpad is a little jittery

  A lot actually. Can be mittigated, but it is not entirely cured.


* I've probably forgotten something

  This was all written after, so I might be missing something.
